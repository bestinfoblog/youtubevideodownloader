<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The&nbsp;</span><strong><span>most popular video application</span></strong><span>&nbsp;on the Internet is YouTube, the platform has a large number of online content creators that in many situations, especially among the youngest, have ousted traditional television.&nbsp;The application is available on all devices, even on Smart TVs, the problem comes when you don't have an Internet connection to watch the videos.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>For this situation, there are&nbsp;</span><strong><span>different alternatives</span></strong><span>&nbsp;with which to prevent us from running out of consuming our favorite content.&nbsp;We show you the three methods that we can use if we are going to be without an Internet connection for some time.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>YouTube Go, the best option to watch videos without an Internet connection</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The great company Google has a multitude of applications to its credit, many of them with a lighter version for devices with limited resources.&nbsp;The&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Go versions</span></strong><span>&nbsp;are designed for this type of smartphone or tablet, but within&nbsp;</span><span>YouTube Go</span><span>&nbsp;we find a possibility that does not exist within the standard version, at least without paying.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>This is the possibility of downloading the videos we want&nbsp;</span><strong><span>from the YouTube library</span></strong><span>&nbsp;, allowing us to access the app when we don't have internet, go to our library and be able to watch the videos without noticing any difference.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>YouTube Premium, the payment option</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>With the advent of paid subscriptions to YouTube, several new features were introduced, among which we find, in addition to advantages for contacting our favorite content creators, even the possibility of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>downloading videos in full resolution</span></strong><span>&nbsp;to watch them when we don't have an Internet connection.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>As with the previous alternative, we can choose to download the videos and store them in the library, to later access and play them without any problem, in addition to the fact that with this option we will have other advantages such as no ads that interrupt us.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The only drawback to this option is that it entails a payment of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>11.99 euros per month</span></strong><span>&nbsp;, a somewhat high price if you only use YouTube sporadically.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Download your videos externally</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Although within the Play Store itself we are obviously not going to find other options to download YouTube videos, on the web we find other options that can be equally valid.&nbsp;The first of the options is called&nbsp;</span><span>TubeMate</span><span>&nbsp;, an application that works as if it were a browser and from which we will be able to search and download all the videos on the platform.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The next option is called videodownloader.tube</span><span>, with a very similar operation to the previous application we will be able to choose our favorite videos to download them in different formats and allowing us to see them later from the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>gallery of our mobile</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or tablet.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span>These functions are little known and used by users, since Internet connections are now more widespread and upload speeds have reached the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>5G standard</span></strong><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In any case, it is a very useful possibility for when we are going to take a plane or train trip, situations where we cannot use our Internet connection in the best way.</span></p>
